Conclusion & Recommendations","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **There is a high probability that all users track activity data because the tracking process is automated. Although, sleep data can also automatically be tracked, we do see a significant drop in the usage of tracking sleeping. Furthermore, very few users are tracking weight data.**\n\n   **Reccommendation**\n\n   * Tracking activity data is highly adopted by smart device users becuase the process is automated. Users feel comfortable wearing a smart device throughout their day. Bellabeat should continue to expand on the Bellabeat Time collection to offer styles that could cater to a larger audience. A potential customer may want to purchase a smart device, there just simply isn't a style available that suits them.\n   \n   * Even users that are most actively tracking data will show instances where they failed to track on a given day. This could be as a result of forgetting to wear their device before leaving their home or something similar. Could there be a functionality on the Bellabeat App that reminds users to wear their smart device?\n   \n   * Comfort could be a big contributor towards having sleep data being tracked. Some users may choose to remove their smart device while sleeping because they find wearing it while sleeping to be uncomfortable. This is an opportunity for Bellabeat to market the Bellabeat Leaf as a more comfortable solution which won't hinder comfort of sleep. Users can track important sleep data while maintaining the beuty rest they deserve.\n   \n   * The analytics team could take a look at who Bellabeat's most active users are. Users that are showing interest in tracking sleep, activity and weight could be a good target customer to sell the Bellabeat Spring water bottle and membership plan.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **Almost half of smart device users that track sleep data spend more than 30 minutes awake in bed.**\n\n**Reccommendation**\n\n* There is a timeframe where people are in bed but awake. People could possibly be on their phones during this awake which may present a good opportunity for a timeframe to push an internet marketing campaign on social media. This may allow Bellabeat to be more accurate with advertisement strategy and also help with budgeting.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **People who spend less time sedentary get more sleep.**\n\n**Further Investigation**\n\n* This may be a powerful narrative for a Bellabeat marketing campaign. We need to investigate if people are spending less time sedentary after adopting the usage of a smart device. If this is true, this could be a powerful message where 'wearing a bellabeat product gives you more sleep'. Sleep being a hot topic in todays coversation, this could be a very compelling marketing idea.","metadata":{}}]}
